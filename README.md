# Shiny Dashboard

Here is a demo shiny app to be used for the 2018 DSSG education group. This app is intended to display geospatial data about the city of Surrey, all of which is open source.

The ui.R and server.R files are needed together to run the app and the data folder contains all the open source EDI and shape files required to run the app effectively.
